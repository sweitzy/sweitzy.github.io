    <h1>Pioneer Woman Bacon-Wrapped Meatloaf: Everything is Better With Bacon</h1>

    <p>
      My best bubby Bubba made a bacon-wrapped meatloaf for our crew
      at a wine-tasting weekend, and it was delicious.  He is really
      good at whipping things up without a recipe, me not so much
      (although I AM slowly getting better).  I am an engineer and
      want my recipes so I don't have to memorize stuff.

      It was about the same time that the awseome Pioneer Woman first
      appeared online.  She really changed the cooking world, in my
      opinion, in a good way.  You could get the recipes online without
      having to buy a cookbook.  Her liberal use of pictures helped you
      gain confidence that you were following the recipe correctly and
      could replicate her results.

      This recipe was one of the first I made from her first cookbook.
      A few thing annoy me about online recipes, specifically Food
      Network.  You google for a recipe from a cookbook so that you
      can share it with a friend, and the online one varies from the
      one in the cookbook.  I'm too paranoid to want them changing the
      recipe.
