    <h1>We Love Food!</h1>

    <p>My sisters told me long ago that if I wanted a good woman, I
      should learn to cook well.  I took their advice to heart!
      Luckily for the last 10 years, being married to Wendy, my
      cooking has been taken a new level and has really flourished.
      My best buddy Bubba has been a big influence too, and I am very
      grateful to him for that.

      I started a 3 inch 3 ring binder over 10 years ago to keep all
      my recipes.  Before that I had a mess of cookbooks, magazines
      (both with post it notes on them), and printouts.  Now all the
      printouts are in this binder.  With most recipes being online,
      this is very helpful.
