    <h1>We Love Food!</h1>

    <p>My sisters told me long ago that if I wanted a good woman, I
      should learn to cook well.  I took their advice to heart!
      Luckily for the last 10 years, being married to Wendy, my
      cooking has been taken a new level and has really flourished.
      My best buddy Bubba has been a big influence too, and I am very
      grateful to him for that.
