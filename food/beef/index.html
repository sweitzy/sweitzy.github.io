    <h1>What's for Dinner?  Beef!</h1>

    <p>I grew up a cattle/corn farm, so we ate a lot of beef.  I know
      the cattle industry is demonized a lot in the liberal media that
      I consume, and while certainly cattle (and all) farmers can and
      should help to reduce climate change, keep in mind we get a lot
      from cattle: beef, milk, cheese, leather, etc.  That's a lot of
      good stuff!
