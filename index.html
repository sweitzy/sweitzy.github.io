<h1>AKA Scooterland!</h1>
<p>I started this site as a way to learn Web-related technologies.  I
had been head-down for 30 years being a software developer, then
software manager, then software quality assurance manager, but all in
networking/server-related technologies.</p>
<p>While/after being retired for
2 years, the idea of a recipe/tech blog/site seemed appealing.  The
article TBD got me started down this road, and I am going to
experiment with several options, some of them just to play with, to
learn this stuff.</p>
