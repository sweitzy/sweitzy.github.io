<h1>AKA Scooterland!</h1>
<p>I started this site as a way to learn Web-related technologies.  I
had been head-down for 30 years being a software developer, then
software manager, then software quality assurance manager, but all in
networking/server-related technologies.</p>
<p>While/after being retired for
2 years, the idea of a recipe/tech blog/site seemed appealing.  The
article TBD got me started down this road, and I am going to
experiment with several options, some of them just to play with, to
learn this stuff.</p>

target = "_self">Launch a Website with a Custom URL using Github Pages
and Google Domains</a> got me started by using Github pages to create
a static web site.  I'm doing it all manually just to get a sense for
the core technologies.  I'm not good at GUIs and I'm used to writing
technical documents, so my initial writing style is going to look a
little nerdy.</p>
